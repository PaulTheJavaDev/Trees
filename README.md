-Proper Documentation-

First I watched the Video to understand the absolute basics of Trees and how they work.

After I downloaded the java version of the code I looked at it.
It was pretty easy to understand this structured code since it had the explainations needed.

First, as can be seen in the picture below I created a Node class which has a contructor that assigns this.data to the given data.

Now we create a Method which uses recursion to go through each Node in the Tree and adds the data of those Nodes together.
I chose to not make the Method public since we are only using it in the Main.java File.

Before the static Method wants a input of the Node root we have to initialize the Tree which can be seen in the image below.
We start by creating different Nodes with different data.
Then we assign the left and right positions of the children and tails of the Tree to the proper Positions we want.
